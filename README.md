### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a Senior Technologist

I'm passionate about building tools that make learning tech more accessible and engaging. I contribute primarily to the open-source project [`labguide`](https://github.com/suss-vli/labguide), [`suss`](https://github.com/suss-vli/suss}, and [`learntools`](https://github.com/suss-vli/learntools), focusing on enhancing the learning experience for students and educators alike.

#### ðŸ§ª What I Work On

- ðŸ”§ **`labguide`**, **`suss`**, and **`learntools`**: Open-source tools designed to support structured, interactive learning.
- ðŸ¤– **Auto-generated coding lab generator**: A simple front-end labguide generator powered by `dspy` models to automatically create coding labs with solutions â€” helping students practice more effectively.
